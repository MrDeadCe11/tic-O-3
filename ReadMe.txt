This is a modified tic-tac-toe game made by my 8 year old son.  
player one plays as the horizontal line
player two is the vertical line.
the goal of the game is to complete 3 crosses in a row.

the one rule is you cannot chase the other player.  if you play the same square as the player before you two times in a row you automatically lose.
